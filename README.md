Technical Requirements   

 Front-end (App)    

UI should be implemented based on the designs shared  

The app should be responsive based on device screen size.  

Take user input (username and password)  

Consume login API and respond to user of details provided and valid or invalid  

If the user is valid, the user receives a toast message to indicate success then store a message in local database (example: Hi Michelle)  

The application task could use Kotin (only Jetpack Compose) or IOS (SwiftUI)  to compile/transpile into a testable APK or IPA.
